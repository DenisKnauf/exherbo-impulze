SUMMARY="A CD-ROM image access library."
DESCRIPTION="
    CD-ROM image access library which aims to provide uniform access to the data stored in various image formats.
    * Disc layout representation via GObject-based objects representing disc, session, track, language, index, etc.
    * Support for both CD-ROM and DVD-ROM images
    * CD-TEXT, ISRC, MCN and DVD-ROM disc structures support
    * Capable of generating information not provided by image file; for instance, if image provides only user data, sync pattern, header, ECC/EDC codes and subchannel are generated on fly when they are attempted to be accessed.
    * Currently supported image formats:
          o B6T: BlindWrite 5/6 file format
          o C2D: WinOnCD file format
          o CCD: CloneCD image format
          o CDI: DiscJuggler file format
          o CIF: Easy CD Creator format
          o CUE: CDRwin CUE/BIN image format
          o DAA: PowerISO direct access archives (unencrypted)
          o ISO: Classic ISO9660 image format
          o MDS: Alcohol 120% image format
          o NRG: Nero Burning ROM image format
          o TOC: Cdrdao's TOC/BIN image format
    * Plug-in based system that allows simple addition of new image format parsers or data-file access fragments.
    * Debugging; verbosity of debug traces can be adjusted on fly using special debug context objects. Therefore, amount of traces can be adjusted without the need to restart the application.
    * Various utility functions for converting address from/to LBA and MSF, interleaving and deinterleaving subchannel data, ECC/EDC generation, etc.
